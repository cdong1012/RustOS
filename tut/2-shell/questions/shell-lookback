I use kprint in console to print the prefix out every line.
I use StackVec to store bytes of the command typed from the shell cause 
we can push and pop it easily(for adding and subtracting).
I use console's write_byte and read_byte to read keyboard input and write 
them out, which uses the uart's write_byte and read_byte.
I use the command struct and its parse method to process the user's command (echo and exit)
