Xmodem transmission is receiving input from our mini uart. Miniuart is constantly reading bytes through its
io::read function, which internally calls wait_for_byte. This function waits depend on the timeout, and if the timeout 
is not set for the transmission, this function can go into an infinite loop waiting until there is more byte to read.
Also, a problem I ran into when I tested my code after removing the timeout was that it stalls 
forever when xmodem was expecting to receive a specific byte because it keeps retrying that connection.
