The test.sh script uses the -r flag to make a call to io::copy to transmit packet, and 
io::copy is can take data in any size for reader and writer. The test transmits 
random base64 encoded strings between 1 and 512 bytes, and io::copy can handle this. However, 
for xmodem protocol, we can only transmit an array of u8 which can only goes up to 256, so 
base64 datas can't be properly transmitted this way
