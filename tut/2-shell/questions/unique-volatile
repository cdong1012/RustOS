Volatile lets you read and modify a raw pointer. Unique<Volatile> also lets you do this, but 
Unique is a wrapper type for volatile. Unique indicates that the posessor of this wrapper owns
the reference to the raw pointer, making the referent to the raw pointer not modifiable without
a unique path to the Unique reference. This makes it safe to share data of this pointer between 
threads since there can only be one unique pointer to the value in memory.
