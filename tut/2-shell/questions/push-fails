StackVec::push() method can potentially fail if the backing 
array of StackVec is full and we try to push another element in it.
Since StackVec depends on a statically allocated array whose 
size is known at compile time, we can't resize StackVec to store 
more elements. Vec is different because it allocates memory for 
its element on the heap, and it's almost impossible for it to run 
out of space when pushing.
