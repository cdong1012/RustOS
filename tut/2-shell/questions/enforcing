The ReadVolatile only implements the Readable trait, which only has a read function to read 
from a raw pointer. Since it does not have any write function to call write_volatile, it's
impossible to write with a ReadVolatile types. Similarly, the WriteVolatile type only implements 
the Writable trait with a write function calling write_volatile. There is no way for this 
type to call read_volatile to read the underlying pointer.
