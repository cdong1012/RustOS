The bound for type T to outlive life time 'a 
is required because our buffer has the life time of 'a.
Since we are storing elements of type T in our buffer, those 
element should exist as least as long as the buffer itself.
If they don't and get freed before the life time 'a of the buffer,
we can accidentally access those element in the buffer after they get freed.
This can lead to a use-after-freed bug.
