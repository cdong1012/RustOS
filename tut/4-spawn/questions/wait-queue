For round-robin scheduler with these 2 queues, I guess we can just use the ready queue for normal execution, but when a task that can be waited on occurs,
we can then check the waiting queue and move that process to the front of the ready queue. With this, we don't need to keep checking all waiting processes unless
we know something has changed.
Also, if a task occurs, we can start the thread that is waiting immediately, increasing throughput and reducing latency for waiting processes.
