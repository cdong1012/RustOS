When we use x0 to handle both errors and return values, we use less registers for simple syscalls. A disadvantage would be that the return value for x0 is limited to 
only positive number(since negative would mean error).
For us, Rust let us use the Result type to return a real value of an error without having to divide a number range to specify which is a valid value and which is an error
