To set PC to address A using the ret instruction, we set register lr to A before calling ret. 
    mov lr, A

If we execute eret when the current exception level is ELx, the CPU will set PC to 
the value in ELR_ELx. Therefore, we just need to set ELR_ELx to A before calling eret.

    mov x0, A 
    msr ELR_ELx, x0
