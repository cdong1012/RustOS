Sleep's return value will be different from the input value because this syscall depends on the timer interrupt to work. 
If a process calls sleep right before a tick interval to switch to another process, the sleep time returned might be TICK ms + the input ms. 
If sleep is called right after we switch after a TICK, then the return value might be the same as the input value.
