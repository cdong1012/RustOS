We are dedicating bits [63-42] of virtual address for TTBR select. If it's user, we use the base address of user pagetable 
at TTBR1, and for kernel it's the base address at ttbr0. 
The translation table pointed to by TTBR0 is selected when the upper bits of the
virtual address (VA) are all set to 0. TTBR1 is selected when the upper bits of the VA are all set to 1. This is how 
the MMU knows which table to use for a given address without needing to know specifically if the request is from kernel or user.
