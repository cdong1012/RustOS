Some processes will require significantly more stack space than 1MiB, 
but our simple design allocates exactly 1MiB of stack space for all processes. 
Assuming processes have access to dynamic memory allocation, 
how could a process increase its stack size? Be specific about which instructions 
the process would execute.

We create a new stack, copy the existing stack into it, and then either remap virtual memory 
or change SP to point to the new stack location.

let offset = stack.top() - trap_frame.sp;
trap_frame.sp = new_stack.top() - offset;
