Since KernPageTable and UserPageTable are Box structs containing a PageTable, we need to interact with entries inside the PageTable 
itself. Deref and DerefMut gives us the ability to dereference the Box to acess the entries, and these smart pointer can be treated 
like a regular reference. I guess they save us time typing self.0... every time we want to access/modify the pagetable
