When all processes are waiting and wfe is executed, the processes are probably waiting for an interrupt request like FIQ or IRQ for some information or resources to 
continue execute. If the interrupt does not arrive, then the process should not move on without finish waiting for this condition, so wfe waiting forever is correct.
