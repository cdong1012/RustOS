For Level 2 index, we only need to choose from 2 possible value(index 0 or index 1 in l2 table).
Therefore, technically we only need to allocate 1 bit for it.
For TTBR select, this is based on the base address of the table.
We configure the MMU in UserPageTable::alloc to recognize that for user virtual space allocation,
if the virtual address is lower than the USER_IMG_BASE, we panic. 
This way, we protect the kernel space by not having user allocations access the memory below this address split line.
