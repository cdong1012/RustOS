To trap float accesses, first set SCR_EL1.FPEN to 01, 
so we can generate a trap in EL0 when floating point functionality using those registers is used.
This will generate a synchronous exception Syndrome::SimdFp.  
The trap frame can always include the fields for floating point registers, 
but the context_save won't have to store them before transfering into handle_exception.
