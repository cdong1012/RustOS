Your allocator probably creates more fragmentation that it needs to, 
and that’s okay! How could you do better? Sketch (only in writing) 
two brief design ideas for improving your allocator’s fragmentation.

Since I'm rounding up a lot to make everything align, there's definitely internal fragmentation.
So maybe if I make variable sized bins instead of having it rounded up to power of 2, that will
reduce internal fragmentation using the best fit scheme. 
However, that will make my solution of fixing external fragmentation more complicated because
everything is not aligned to the power of 2 anymore.

Another design is that
