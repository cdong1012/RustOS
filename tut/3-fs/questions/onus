In C, the allocator has to record the size in the memory allocated block to use 
when it frees it, so since Rust can eliminate recording the size in the block itself,
Rust's allocation will be faster and cleaner. For the caller, Rust ensures the alignment is legit
through its restriction, so all the work on the onus is done by the allocator, not the caller.
