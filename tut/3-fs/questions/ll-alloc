If we had used the regular kind of linked list, we have to allocate space for a pointer pointing
to the data beside the next/prev pointer we need. If that's the case, we have to find a way to 
allocate the memory space the user needs to store the data, which is more work. Using an intrusive 
linked list, the user can just store the data right inside the node.
