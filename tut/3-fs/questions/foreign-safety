When we use extern to use foreign code, Rust can only provide, for example, parameters to an external C function.
The C function that will be called can have bugs that Rust can't check because the Rust compiler isn't designed to 
check the syntax of and compile C code. The compiler can only statically check for Rust code for correctness and safety.
