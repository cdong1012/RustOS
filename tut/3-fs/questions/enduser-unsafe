The benefit to expose safe interfaces to unsafe features is that we can prevent the end user 
to directly perform unsafe operations. Through the safe interface as the middle man, we can 
enforce safety features and boundaries before performing the unsafe operations, which makes our
overall codes safe even when we call unsafe operations! We can yield the same benefits in C but C
is unsafe overall and it's hard for us to actually cover all unsafe test cases while keeping the overhead low.
