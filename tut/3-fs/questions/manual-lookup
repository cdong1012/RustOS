First we look into the EBPB to find the cluster number of the root directory(usually cluster 2).
After we navigate to this, we will get to the regular directory entry of root. 
Each entry is 32 bytes, so we can keep checking downward from the first entry. Checking at offset 0xb or 11 for a value 
of 0x10 signifying that the entry correspond to a directory. Then We look at the name at offset 0 for the name "a". If 
it matches, we found the a directory entry. We can go inside directory "a" by looking at the offset 0x1a or 26 to find the 
entry cluster number. We repeat this until we get to "b" directory.
After we get here, we can check the name("c") at offset 0 and the type ("txt") at offset 0x8 to look for file c.txt in 
directory b
