The max number of clusters that a FAT32 file system can have is 2^28 clusters. Since every cluster has 1 associated FAT 
entry in FAT to represent them, the number of clusters depends on how many bits we use to represent entries.
Since only 28 bits are used to represent FAT entries, we can have 2^28 different entries, which means our file system can have 
2^28 clusters.
The limitation is the similar to FAT16, but unlike FAT32 where the upper 4 bits of the entries are ignored, FAT16 uses 
the whole 16 bits to represent FAT entries. The number of clusters for FAT16 is limited to 2^16 as a result.
