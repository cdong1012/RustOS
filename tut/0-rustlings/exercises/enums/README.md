### Enums

Rust allows you to define a type called `enums` which allow you to enumerate possible values. In combination with enums, we have the concept of `pattern matching` in Rust, which makes it easy to run different code for different values of an enumeration. Enums, while available in many languages, Rust's enums are most similar to `algebraic data types` in functional languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.
